# SASGP: Stochastic Active Sets for Gaussian Processes
In this repository, you can find all the files for running the models and experiments described in our paper [Revisiting Active Sets for Gaussian Process Decoders](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rAVqc7KSGDa). 

## ü•¨ Basic use

## ü´ë Basic use

The main file for training the SAS-GP and learn the probabilistic representation is `train.py`. In particular, you can make several combinations among the following choices. 


For extra arguments and options, check `/utils/command_line_parser.py`.
